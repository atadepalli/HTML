<footer><h3>I mostly play at the defensive tackle on a 4-3 defensive scheme.
    I was drafted in the 2026 nfl draft class and was selected in the 1st round pick 18 by the Philadeplhia eagles. 
    I love it here, I had the opturnity to learn under Fletcher Cox for a year. 
    And then of course I took over the starting job next year.
    I recorded a combinded total of 59.5 sacks in college with the Ohio State Buckeyes.
My first year in the NFL I recorded 8 sacks.This upcoming year, my goal is to have a monster year with double digit sacks.</h3S></footer>
